## CI/CD Pipeline Activation

### üéØ CI/CD Pipeline Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ

Automated Docker Hub publishing is now live! Every push to main automatically:

- Runs comprehensive test suite (62 tests)
- Builds and publishes to ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot (configured via secrets, default jamesmcmahon0)
- Creates versioned releases and security scans

Deploy anywhere with: `docker-compose up -d`

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The CI/CD pipeline automatically:

- **On every push to main**: Build and publish `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:latest`
- **On every commit**: Build and publish `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:sha-abcd123`
- **On version tags**: Create releases and publish `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:v1.x.x`

### Automated Publishing

The Docker image is automatically published to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions:
- **Push to main**: Publishes `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:latest`
- **Version tags**: Publishes `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:v1.x.x`
- **Commits**: Publishes `${DOCKER_USERNAME}/gartan_scraper_bot:sha-abcd123`

No manual building required!
