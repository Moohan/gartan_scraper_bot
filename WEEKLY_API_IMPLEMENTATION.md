# Weekly Availability API Endpoints - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented two new API endpoints for weekly crew availability tracking:

### New Endpoints

1. **`GET /v1/crew/{id}/hours-this-week`**
   - Returns hours crew member has been available since Monday
   - Response format: `{"hours_this_week": 42.75}`

2. **`GET /v1/crew/{id}/hours-planned-week`**
   - Returns total planned + actual availability hours for current week
   - Response format: `{"hours_planned_week": 84.0}`

### Implementation Details

- **Week Calculation**: Monday 00:00:00 to Sunday 23:59:59
- **Hour Precision**: Rounded to 2 decimal places
- **Time Boundaries**: Properly handles overlapping blocks and cross-week availability
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing API patterns (404 for missing crew, 500 for server errors)

### Database Integration

The implementation leverages the existing `crew_availability` table structure:
- Calculates hours from availability blocks within week boundaries
- Handles partial blocks (clips to week start/end and current time)
- Supports multiple separate availability periods

### Testing

- Comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases covering:
  - Week boundary calculations
  - Error handling for non-existent crew
  - Scenarios with no availability data
  - Partial week availability periods
  - Cross-week availability spanning
  - Multiple separate availability blocks
  - Hour precision calculations

### API Specification

Updated `specification/api_specification.md` to include:
- New endpoints in Phase 2 (Duration & Weekly Analytics)
- Complete documentation with example requests/responses
- Integration with existing API patterns

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get hours available since Monday
curl "https://api.gartan-availability.local/v1/crew/5/hours-this-week"
# Response: {"hours_this_week": 42.75}

# Get total planned weekly hours
curl "https://api.gartan-availability.local/v1/crew/5/hours-planned-week"
# Response: {"hours_planned_week": 84.0}
```
