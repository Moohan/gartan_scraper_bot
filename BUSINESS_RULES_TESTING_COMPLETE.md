# Business Rules Test Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully expanded the test suite with comprehensive business rules validation and API testing. Added 19 new tests covering P22P6 appliance business rules enforcement and API validation scenarios.

## Business Rules Implemented and Tested

### P22P6 Fire Appliance Operational Requirements
The following business rules are now enforced in both API endpoints and dashboard:

1. **Minimum Crew Requirement**: At least 4 crew members must be available
2. **TTR Officer Requirement**: At least 1 crew member with TTR (Tactical Response Team) skill must be available
3. **LGV Driver Requirement**: At least 1 crew member with LGV (Large Goods Vehicle) skill must be available
4. **BA Crew Requirement**: At least 2 crew members with BA (Breathing Apparatus) skill who do NOT have TTR skill
5. **Senior BA Requirement**: At least 1 crew member with FFC+ rank (FFC/CC/WC/CM) who has BA skill

### API Endpoints Enhanced
- `/appliances/P22P6/available`: Now enforces all business rules before returning availability
- `/appliances/P22P6/duration`: Returns `null` if business rules fail, even if appliance is physically available
- Business rules logic extracted into reusable `check_p22p6_business_rules()` function
- Dashboard updated to use centralized business rules function (eliminates code duplication)

## Test Categories Added

### 1. P22P6BusinessRules (8 tests)
- `test_p22p6_all_rules_pass`: Validates appliance available when all requirements met
- `test_p22p6_insufficient_crew`: Tests failure with <4 crew members
- `test_p22p6_no_ttr_officer`: Tests failure without TTR-qualified officer
- `test_p22p6_no_lgv_driver`: Tests failure without LGV-qualified driver
- `test_p22p6_insufficient_ba_crew`: Tests failure with <2 BA crew (excluding TTR)
- `test_p22p6_no_senior_ba_crew`: Tests failure without FFC+ ranked BA crew
- `test_p22p6_minimal_valid_configuration`: Tests exact minimum requirements
- `test_p22p6_appliance_physically_unavailable`: Tests appliance hardware unavailability

### 2. APIValidationScenarios (7 tests)
- `test_crew_list_with_display_names`: Validates display name extraction from contact data
- `test_crew_list_without_display_names`: Tests graceful handling of missing display names
- `test_skill_counting_accuracy`: Validates accurate skill counting logic
- `test_mixed_availability_scenarios`: Tests complex availability patterns
- `test_reason_code_edge_cases`: Tests 'O' (Off), 'W' (Working) reason code handling
- `test_duration_reasonableness`: Tests duration quality filters (7-day limits)
- `test_time_boundary_edge_cases`: Tests edge cases around current time boundaries

### 3. DataQualityValidation (4 tests)
- `test_crew_endpoint_existence`: Validates all crew members have working endpoints
- `test_nonexistent_crew_handling`: Tests proper error handling for invalid crew IDs
- `test_appliance_endpoint_consistency`: Tests appliance endpoint reliability
- `test_data_freshness_filters`: Tests old data filtering (7-day recency rules)

## Technical Implementation

### Robust Testing Patterns
- **Isolated Test Databases**: Each test uses temporary SQLite database with proper setup/teardown
- **Controlled Test Data**: Tests create specific crew configurations to validate exact scenarios
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Tests invalid inputs, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Integration Testing**: Tests interact with actual API functions, not mocks
- **Deterministic Results**: All tests avoid time-dependent or random behaviors

### Business Rules Engine
```python
def check_p22p6_business_rules() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Check P22P6 business rules against available crew."""
    # Returns: rules_pass (bool), rules (dict), details (dict)
```

### API Enhancement
- P22P6 availability now requires both physical availability AND business rules compliance
- Other appliances continue using basic availability checking
- Centralized business rules logic prevents code duplication
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 96 → 115 tests (19 new business rules tests added)
- **All Tests Passing**: ✅ 115/115 tests pass
- **Coverage**: Business rules, API validation, data quality, edge cases, error handling
- **Integration Verified**: Real database interactions, no mocking of core business logic

## Quality Assurance
- **Linting Clean**: All new code passes flake8 standards
- **Type Safety**: Proper type hints and error handling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and test descriptions
- **Maintainability**: Modular test classes, reusable helper functions
- **Production Ready**: Tests use same code paths as production API

## Deployment Impact
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing API behavior unchanged for non-P22P6 appliances
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: P22P6 availability now reflects operational reality
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Dashboard and API share same business rules logic
- **Improved Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
