- **PARSING**: HTML parsing, data extraction failures
- **AUTHENTICATION**: Login failures, session timeouts
- **CONFIGURATION**: Missing settings, invalid values
- **VALIDATION**: Data validation, type checking
- **RESOURCE**: Memory, disk space, system limits
- **EXTERNAL**: Third-party service failures

### Retry Strategies
- Exponential backoff with configurable base delay and maximum
- Random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Per-category retry limits based on error type
- Circuit breaker patterns for persistent failures

### Health Monitoring

- ✅ Error classification working correctly for all exception types
- ✅ Retry mechanisms validated with exponential backoff
- ✅ Health monitoring functional with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Performance tracking integrated across all operations
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
